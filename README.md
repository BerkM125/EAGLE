Easy A** Game & graphics Library and Engine (OpenGL). Cross platform graphics engine for simple graphics.
## Some quick prerequisites
EAGLE is written in pure C++ and OpenGL with the GLUT/FreeGLUT library, and built with a shell script requiring g++. 
## What is EAGLE?
It's pretty self explanatory through the title, yet for clarity's sake EAGLE is a highly convenient yet powerful graphics library and engine that can be used to make 3d graphics, games, and animations. Being that it's been developed for only around 2 days (6/15/21), EAGLE is still in its basic and development stages, with many of its planned features, namely:

1) Physics engine
2) GUI + Editor
3) Textures and Shaders
4) Modeling interface

To be coming soon later. For the time being, EAGLE supports many basic yet useful features, such as:

1) Mesh loading + rendering
2) Camera functionality and vector transformation
3) 3D figure geometry
4) 3D transformation
5) Vertex buffer support
6) Blending + 4-byte color capability
7) Shader loading (implementation still buggy, will patch later)
8) Basic collision detection
9) Basic texturing and texture mapping
